                         the other in winter. An important criterion is the wear resistance of tires. It is influenced

                         a necessary thing for everyday life. Moreover their whole life is in their mobile phone.
                         As for me I can’t imagine my life without a telephone now. Lately mobile phones have become
                         not only a thing which is used to call people but a lot more. Mobiles have taken the place of
                         computers and laptops...

                  value: Computers have become an important part of our everyday life. We use computers every day,
                         though not everyone realizes it. Even smartphones that are hidden in our bags and pockets are
                         actually small computers. Most people think that a computer is a big thing with a display,
                         a keyboard and a mouse. Old computers of the 1990-th really looked like this. Computers contain
                         a bunch of useful programs such as Word, Excel, an Internet browser with e-mail boxes and
                         social networks. You can install video games and play all day long.
                         Modern computers are not very big, laptops are actually small and light. But they are as fast
                         as desktop computers or even faster. I like laptops because they are portable and you don’t
                         need to replace and upgrade hardware...
